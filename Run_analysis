## 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
path="C:/Users/Veronika/Documents/R files/UCI HAR Dataset"
setwd(paste(path,"/train",sep=""))
x_train<-read.table("X_train.txt")
y_train<-read.table("y_train.txt")
subject_train<-read.table("subject_train.txt")

setwd(paste(path,"/test",sep=""))
x_test<-read.table("X_test.txt")
y_test<-read.table("y_test.txt")
subject_test<-read.table("subject_test.txt ")
##Understanding dimensions to correctly bind the tables
dim(y_test)
dim(x_test)
dim(subject_test)

X<-rbind(x_test,x_train)

setwd(path)
features<- read.table ("features.txt")
str(features)
##features table has to be transposed 
features_t<-t(features)
colnames(X) <- features_t[2,]

##bind X table to subject and activity data
subject<- rbind(subject_test, subject_train)
colnames(subject) <- "subject"
activity<- rbind(y_test,y_train)
colnames(activity) <- "activity"
X<-cbind(X, subject,activity)

## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
selection<-which(grepl("mean()|std()",features[,2])==TRUE)

##Select mean and std variables, plus activity and subject columns
X_selected<-X[,c(selection, 562,563)]

## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
activities<-read.table("activity_labels.txt")
activities<-activities[,2]  ##converting activity_label column from factor to vector
activities<-as.character(activities)

## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
X_selected[,"activity"]<-as.numeric(X[,"activity"])
for (k in 1:6) {
  X_selected[,"activity"]<-gsub (k, activities[k], X[,"activity"])}

## 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
library(reshape2)
X_melt<-melt(X_selected,id=c("subject","activity"),measure.vars=c(1:79))
X_mean<-dcast(X_melt,subject+activity~variable,mean)

##Save the results
write.table(X_mean, file= paste0(path,"/means.txt",sep=""), sep=",",row.name=FALSE)
